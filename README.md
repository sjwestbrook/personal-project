# personal-project



Take the most recent working back end (minus Ryan's current front end) and make my front end. Make it match up to the endpoints below.
Focus on LESS and Webpack. Make responsive if time allows. Make an edit page if time allows (e.g. remove a student form a cohort if time allows.).



ADMIN SECTION
Make a survey with swappable parts.

TEMPLATES  -- first page
Name,

Subject - whatever was taught that day, 
Recipient Group,

"how did Jarod do?"  Jarod must be replaceable - use an escape sequence eg $$instructor_name$$
